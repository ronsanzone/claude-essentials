name: html-report
description: Use when a caller has compiled content (sections, prose, code, diagrams) and needs to render it as a self-contained HTML technical report. Owns structural UX (TOC, scroll-spy, progress bar, marginalia, collapsible sections, SVG diagram cards) and visual design languages. Used by code-tour; intended for future report-producing skills.

# html-report

Render a self-contained HTML report from compiled content, applying a curated design language. Brand-guidelines philosophy: locked font stack and anchor palette per language; free composition within.

## Usage

Invoked by a calling skill (e.g. `code-tour`) with:

- **content** — compiled outline (sections, prose, code with `file:line` citations, tables, callouts, diagram briefs)
- **audience** — one of: `engineer-internal-ramp-up`, `engineer-internal-pr-review`, `stakeholder-external`
- **design-language** — identifier matching a file in `design-languages/` (e.g. `editorial-parchment`)
- **hero** — title, lede, eyebrow text, meta pills
- **output-path** — absolute path for the resulting HTML file

## Process

### Step 1: Validate inputs

Confirm the caller supplied:

- `content` — non-empty compiled outline
- `audience` — one of `engineer-internal-ramp-up`, `engineer-internal-pr-review`, `stakeholder-external`
- `design-language` — exists as a file in `design-languages/`
- `hero` — at minimum a title; lede, eyebrow, meta-row are optional
- `output-path` — absolute path; parent directory exists

If `design-language` is not supplied, fall back using the heuristic in `design-languages/README.md`.

### Step 2: Load references

Read all of these in parallel (single message, multiple Read calls):

- `references/structural-shell.md`
- `references/content-components.md`
- `references/diagram-kit.md`
- `design-languages/<chosen>.md`

### Step 3: Absorb the exemplar

Read at least one of the exemplar reports listed in the chosen design language file. The exemplar is evidence of the language, not a template — absorb the composition, the rhythm, the level of detail, then close it and write fresh HTML. Do not clone it.

### Step 4: Dispatch a fresh `general-purpose` subagent for rendering

The rendering work is composition (writing HTML/CSS/SVG informed by provided references), not codebase analysis. Dispatch a fresh subagent so it commits cleanly to the aesthetic without context bleed from the caller's research phase.

The subagent prompt must include:

1. The chosen design language file (full content).
2. All three reference files (full content).
3. At least one exemplar's content (as a context reference — *not* a file to clone).
4. The compiled content payload.
5. The audience and hero metadata.
6. The output path.
7. Explicit instructions:
   - Write one self-contained HTML file (all CSS/SVG inline, fonts via Google Fonts CDN, no other external dependencies).
   - Honor every locked element in the design language (font stack, anchor palette, anti-patterns).
   - Compose freely within the language. Vary per report so two reports in the same language don't feel xeroxed.
   - Use the canonical scroll-spy JS and TOC HTML structure from `references/structural-shell.md` verbatim.
   - Apply the role-to-palette map from the design language file for all diagram nodes.
   - Return the absolute path on completion.

### Step 5: Return the output path

Print the absolute path to the rendered HTML. Do not invoke `open` — the caller decides whether to.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Research, content compilation, dimension selection — the caller owns these.
- Open the resulting file in a browser — the caller decides.
- Iterate on the report after the first pass — the caller (or the user) drives iteration by re-invoking with adjusted content or a different language.
