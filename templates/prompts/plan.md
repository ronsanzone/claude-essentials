## Research

Review the research document if available: docs/plans/*-research.md

## Instructions

Create a detailed implementation plan following TDD principles:

1. Break work into small, testable tasks
2. Each task: write failing test -> implement -> verify -> commit
3. Include exact file paths and code snippets
4. Document expected test commands and outputs

Save plan to: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-implementation.md

Use the writing-plans skill format if available.
