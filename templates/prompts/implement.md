# Implementation

## Plan

Follow the implementation plan: docs/plans/*-implementation.md

## Instructions

Execute the plan task by task:

1. Read the current task from the plan
2. Write the failing test first
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Run tests to verify
5. Commit with clear message
6. Move to next task

Use the executing-plans skill if available.

## Checkpoints

Stop and verify at:
- After each task completes
- When encountering unexpected behavior
- Before starting a new component
